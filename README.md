# QuantumComputingAndMachineLearning

This repository consists of my work on the implementation of quantum algorithms/creation of quantum circuits using the Qiskit python package,I will update this repository as my learning journey progresses.

1) <b>Intro.ipynb</b> - In this notebook, how to create a qubit, create a quantum circuit, execute it using the simulator, and get the state vector after executing basic operations on the qubit.
