# QuantumComputingAndMachineLearning

This repository consists of my work on implementation of quantum algorithms/creation of quantum circuits using Qiskit python package

1) Intro.ipynb - In this notebook, how to create qubit, create a quantum circuit and execute it using simulator and get the state vector after executing and basic operations on qubit.
