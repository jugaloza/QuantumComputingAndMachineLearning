# QuantumComputingAndMachineLearning

This repository consists of my work on the implementation of quantum algorithms/creation of quantum circuits using the Qiskit python package, I will update this repository as my learning journey progresses.

1) <b>Intro.ipynb</b> - In this notebook, how to create a qubit, create a quantum circuit, execute it using the simulator, and get the state vector after executing basic operations on the qubit.
2) <b>QuantumCircuits.ipynb </b> - In this notebook, contains various operations on Quantum bits using various quantum gates in a quantum circuit and measuring the outcome of the quantum circuits.
3) <b>quantumEntanglementAndquantumTeleportation.ipynb </b> - This notebook, contains circuit for creating entangledstates/bell states using quantum register, also contains quantum circuit for teleporting qubit by taking example of sending qubit from Alice to bob.
